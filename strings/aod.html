<b>Why don't I have an Always-On-Display?</b>

If your device has an LCD, AODs are pointless as the backlight of the LCD will be on - no matter what's been shown on screen.

AODs make more sense on an AMOLED, where individual pixels can turn off entirely, thus saving battery.


<b>Why can't I customize my AOD?</b>

This is due to something that\'s often referred to as a ram-less display, meaning that your display only uses the device's Ram, which limits its capabilities a bit. This isn't something bad at all. It's just the conventional way displays are made.

Your phone's display quite likely simply doesn't support this additional feature. Currently, it's only working on the GT, GT Neo, X50 Pro, X2, X2 Pro, X, XT and X7 Max.
