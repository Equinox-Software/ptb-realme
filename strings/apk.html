<u>Apk cannot be installed</u>


This can have multiple reasons:


<b>Insufficient storage</b>

Your storage may be insufficient. Please make sure that you have at least 500MB plus the size of your APK available.


<b>Wrong Android version</b>

The Android SDK version required by the App may be higher than what your device currently runs on.


<b>Wrong device</b>

Maybe the APK was made for a specific device only, meaning that some configurations or resources for your specific device might not be available.


<b>App already installed</b>

Maybe some app blocks the installation. This could also be if the installed App has a higher version than the one you want to install. In this case, you may want to firstly uninstall current App, then reinstall yours.
