<u>How to ask</u>

<b>1. Formulate the question</b>

Make sure to include:
· The device you use
· Your current Android Version
· Version of the currently installed App
· What you want to do
· What you have tried already
· Why you want to do that
· What benefits you expected
· The output you got


<b>2. Wait for a response</b>

Give the community 48h to answer your question. The needed expert might not be available all the
time, so receiving an answer might take a bit.


<b>3. No answer yet</b>

Use /experts and tag the experts, whose segment fits your issue. If you didn't receive an answer after a week, use /form and fill out the linked form.


These suggestions enable us to provide you with better answers quicker and will keep this chat
more focused.
