<b>Benchmark your device ðŸ’ª</b>

For reference we're using two different benchmarks to compare devices in this group. Please install
them via the below links.

Â· CPU Performance:
<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.primatelabs.geekbench5'>Geekbench 5 â¬‡</a>

Â· Gaming Performance:
<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futuremark.dmandroid.application'>3DMark (Wild Life) â¬‡</a>

Now open them and see if they need anything downloaded first. After that switch your phone to
maximum performance:
Â· Disable any energy saving option that's currently active.
Â· Set your phone to performance mode.
Â· Close all open Apps via your launchers 'clear all' button
Â· Set your phone to airplane mode.

Let your phone run Geekbench first and take a screenshot of the score at the end.

Repeat this process three more times. Also take screenshots after each run. This is to test
sustained performance. (#TODO might add heat check app here)

Close all applications again, let your device cool down for a few minutes. Then repeat the process
for 3DMark (Wild Life).

Once you're done with all the screenshots, upload your first and last score of each benchmark (so
four images in total) as an album in @realme_offtopic and put #Benchmark the Android-Version, for example
#Android11 and your device model, for example #RMX1931 in the caption of this album.
