<u>Bug report</u>


<i>If you face an issue that is clearly a bug and can't be resolved by the community after some time, you can also let
    the developers know. Don't abuse this functionality, so that the devs can focus on developing.</i>


Please provide as much useful information as possible.


Just go to your dialer and dial <code>*#800#</code> in.


Alternatively you can also do that in the feedback section of the toolkit app.
