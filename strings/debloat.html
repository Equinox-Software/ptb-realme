<u>Debloat</u>
<i>There's two major ways of having a device debloated: flashing a debloated Rom or rooting your device and uninstalling
    things yourself. These methods void your warranty and can be risky!</i>

If you just want some free space or block apps from running, try /cleaners


<b>The alternative solution</b>
1. Install ADB on your Computer

2. Enable USB-Debugging on your device, plug your phone into the Computer

3. Open the command prompt and type in <code>adb shell</code> and then <code>adb
    devices</code> and make sure yours is listed there.

<b>Make sure you know exactly what Application you want to remove! Some are required by the system and might make it
    unstable or result in a crash.</b>

4. To uninstall apps type in <code>pm uninstall -k --user 0 PACKAGE-NAME</code> - for example:
<code>pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.facebook.katana</code>,
