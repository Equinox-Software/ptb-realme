<u>App-Services not found</u>

Be very careful with what application you uninstall as some might be needed for your device to run properly! If you just want to free up some space, try /debloat instead."

The error can occur if you installed an Apk that was not made for your device (see /manual for more on that).

The solution is to uninstall the previously installed App. If you can't uninstall the app like you'd normally do, you can also use
<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fooview.android.fooview'>fooView</a>.

It often happens with Phone-Manager, so we'll use this App as an example here.
