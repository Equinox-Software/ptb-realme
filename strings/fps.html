<b>High FPS & optimization for games</b>

<i>The following is based on personal opinion and experience by @nyx69 and also shortened up a bit to focus on more important parts.</i>

A game can be incredibly demanding these days and the company developing such game has to make sure that all the needed actions can happen in an even shorter amount of time between the frames. Therefore this company has to put a lot of effort into optimizing it for the devices they want to release it on, some a bit more and others a bit less.

Also, the company providing Hardware has to optimize a few things to squeeze out the last bit of performance. On the other hand they can't just go for full performance as it may ruin the entire experience due to overheating, instability and what not.

Finally, I want to stress again how massively demanding a game can be. In my experience with natively developing comparable applications I can only say that it can be very painful and that you're also limited by the technologies you use and the resources, especially time and money, you have.

No need to be ignorant or pissed about it, but instead massive kudos to those developers and their hard work. And also my personal respect for the ones that have to find the right mix for a phone to provide the best performance for a specific type of device at a certain pricepoint.
