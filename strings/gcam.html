To enable these configurations, place them in <b>Internal Storage > GCam > Configs7</b>.


Then go to your GCam and press on the bottom left (next to the camera switch button) a few times. A dialog should appear where your can select the desired configuration.


Feel free to fiddle around with LibPatcher (in GCam's settings) a little to shape the image output so that it fits your needs.
