Urnyx05's releases work well on most Realme devices. Take a look at @googlecameraport
for other releases.

<b>Configurations</b>

Device specific configurations lead to better image quality. You can get configurations from <a href='https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/f/configs-urnyx-02/'>Urnyx05's page</a>. These configurations are optimized for a specific device, but may work for other devices aswell. Just give them a try 😊

To enable these configurations, place them in <b>Internal Storage > GCam > Configs7</b>.

Then go to your GCam and press on the bottom left (next to the camera switch button) a few times. A dialog should appear where your can select the desired configuration.

Also feel free to fiddle around with LibPatcher (in GCam's settings) a little to shape the image output so that it fits your needs.
