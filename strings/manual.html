<u>Updating System-Apps manually</u>


Updating your System-Apps via Apks you find somewhere on the Internet or here on Telegram is often pointless, as you quite likely have the latest proper and optimized version of these Apps installed on your device anyway.


You should therefore not really be in need of flashing them manually.


âš  Installing these Apps yourself may actually be worse, as those files are very often not explicitly for your device and may therefore lack specific optimization or may not even work as they should.


Be very careful with what you install. It's better to wait for the next automatic software-update ðŸ˜‰
