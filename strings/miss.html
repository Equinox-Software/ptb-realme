You just missed this update.


Early Access usually is...

- for India only

- rolled out in 1-3 batches

- limited to 500 people per batch

- pushed randomly to users' devices


Resulting in a small group of people getting access  enables for more controlled testing and less possible issues.


You can either wait for the next batch to be released, but chances of being selected are very low. Preferably wait for stable release (tap /stable for more).
