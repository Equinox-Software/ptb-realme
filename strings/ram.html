<u>Virtual Ram</u>


<i>This is based on personal experience by @nyx69</i>


As 2GB of Ram are not much, I tested a comparable principle on my J7 2016 with even less Ram.


It worked, but the performance increase was barely noticeable. It created a swap-file on my storage, which is not as blazing fast as Ram.


The current Realme devices come with UFS2.0 storage, some even UFS3.1, and more processing power.


For Virtual Ram I only expect a very slight performance increase, so please don't hype it up that much ðŸ˜‰
