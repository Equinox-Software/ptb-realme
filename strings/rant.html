<b>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ðŸ•Š</b>

<i>A small rant by me, @nyx69 (I made this bot by the way). The following is not affiliated with Realme. These are my
    own personal thoughts as a developer for a rather big German company myself.</i>

Actually it's better to not have some actual date. So that Realme can release things, if they meet their requirements.

Take Cyberpunk for instance. They had to release an unfinished crap full of bugs, because moving the release date yet another time would have caused big trouble with investors and public.


Additionally, just too many members of this group don't seem to understand the concept of announcements and plans. All the dates given are estimates, not exact ones at all. I'll therefore dive a bit deeper in the following paragraphs.

Realme's few developers are working very hard to bring out updates and fixes for all these devices they threw on the market. Obviously those updates we see take some time and testing. They won't just do all that in five minutes straight.

Their developers focus on important things for the company itself as mentioned already. Especially as Realme has a very limited capacity when it comes to developers. So simply wait as those minor fixes aren't a huge game changer anyway.


I get it. You pay the company for a device and you already own this device. The company itself offers free updates as a bonus on top of that. The have to earn more money from advertising those updates and selling devices than what maintenance and development costs.

Therefore, it's better for them to pack a few updates together and release them all at once rather than doing every single bit and piece individually. A company will always act in a way that they profit as much as possible. That's just natural. That's how economy works.

Crying, shouting, anger and whatsoever won't bring any benefit into this game. So it's better to just relax and focus on the actually important things in life. Those minor improvements are not worth all the panic you tend to create. You won't die just because you receive something rather unimportant a few more days later.
