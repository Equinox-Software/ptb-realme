<i>Realme rolls out an Update, if it works as expected - not if a certain date is met. Therefore, an exact date for when
    you will receive an update doesn't exist.</i>


<b>Estimating the stable release date</b>

Use /android11 and add a minimum of 6 months after the Early Access date. This is the timeframe developers currently need to go from Beta to Stable.


Developers are working very hard currently, but it may still take some time. Please stand by.
